# 🕵️Bug Autopsy

Bug Autopsy is a developer-focused project for **systematically analyzing and documenting software bugs**.  
Instead of fixing bugs and moving on, this project treats each bug as a **case study** to capture root cause, fix, and prevention insights.

## 📌 What This Project Is

A learning-oriented application that helps developers:
- Break down bugs in a structured way
- Understand *why* bugs happen
- Build long-term debugging intuition

This project focuses on **thinking clarity**, not just code fixes.

## 🚀 Core Features

- Structured bug analysis format
- Clear separation of symptoms, cause, and fix
- Reproducible bug documentation
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly
- Suitable for personal learning and practice projects

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A bug is identified from any project
2. The bug is documented using a fixed structure
3. The root cause is analyzed instead of guessed
4. A fix is applied and recorded
5. A prevention note is added to avoid similar bugs

This creates a **knowledge base of real debugging lessons**.

## 📝 Bug Case Format

Each bug is documented using the following structure:

Title:
Short description of the bug.

Symptoms:
What went wrong? What was observed?

Reproduction Steps:
1.
2.
3.

Root Cause:
Why the bug actually happened.

Fix:
What change resolved the issue.

Prevention:
