# 🕵️Bug Autopsy

Bug Autopsy is a developer-focused project for **systematically analyzing and documenting software bugs**.  
Instead of fixing bugs and moving on, this project treats each bug as a **case study** to capture root cause, fix, and prevention insights.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A bug is identified from any project
2. The bug is documented using a fixed structure
3. The root cause is analyzed instead of guessed
4. A fix is applied and recorded
5. A prevention note is added to avoid similar bugs

This creates a **knowledge base of real debugging lessons**.

---

## 📝 Bug Case Format

Each bug is documented using the following structure:

Title:
Short description of the bug.

Symptoms:
What went wrong? What was observed?

Reproduction Steps:
1. Root Cause:
Why the bug actually happened.

2. Fix:
What change resolved the issue.

3. Prevention:
How similar bugs can be avoided in the future.
